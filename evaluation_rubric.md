| **1. Relevance to Provided Context**  | Directly ties to key concepts, examples, or terminology from the provided context. | Partially relevant but misses critical details or examples from the context.                    | Irrelevant or misaligned with the context (e.g., introduces unrelated topics).                   |
| **2. Alignment with Learning Outcomes** | Tests a specific skill/knowledge stated in the learning outcomes. | Vaguely related to outcomes but lacks specificity or depth.                                     | Fails to address any stated learning outcome.                                                    |
| **3. Distractor Quality**             | Distractors are plausible and reflect common misconceptions/mistakes. | Some distractors are too obvious or lack real-world relevance.                                  | Distractors are illogical, nonsensical, or non-functional.                                       |
| **4. Clarity and Precision**          | Unambiguous wording, code examples are syntactically correct, and only one correct answer.     | Minor ambiguities or typos, but answerable.                                                    | Confusing wording, code errors, or multiple valid answers.                                      |
| **5. Difficulty Level**                     | **Difficult**: Promotes high-level thinking, problem-solving, or evaluation.  | **Medium**: Requires application of knowledge in familiar scenarios. May involve debugging simple code or interpreting logic. |**Easy**: Tests basic recall or straightforward application.  |
